# Kickstarter-analysis
Perfoming analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends
## Overview of Project
Louiseâ€™s play Fever came close to its fundraising goal in a short amount of time. Now, she wants to know how different campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals.

Louis wants to launch a theater performance and estimates a budget of $ 10,000, she doubts that the budget she has is the right type of theater for her fundraising campaign, so she obtains a database with projects similar to hers.

### Purpose

The purpose of this analysis is to help Louis make the best decision for his theater project to be successful, she is considering a budget of more than $ 10,000 dollars.
She is hesitant about her budget and needs us to help her determine specific factors that make a company successful through an Excel database with similar projects.

## Analysis and Challenges
Using a database in excel, you must configure the readable information, with respect to the data in the database you must extract the missing information and by formulating the parameters, Louis will be helped to have the correct information so that you make the best decision regarding the amount to be raised and the ideal date for your project to be successful.

The challenge of the analysis that I did, is through the information provided in the database and the use of advanced Excel tools to arrive at a detailed analysis that allows Louis to make the best decision.


### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

Through the exploration of this information, it was determined that the months where the plays had a higher percentage to be successful are in May and June with a percentage of 67 and 65 percent respectively.
The months of August, October and December were where more theater projects were not successful.
The months with the most canceled projects were January, September and December.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
Through this analysis it was highlighted that the number of most successful projects with respect to the goals ranges from 1000 to 4999 and those that are less than 1000, another important point that was determined is that the theater plays classification there were no canceled projects In no defined range, another important point is that while the goal was higher, the percentage of success decreased radically.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
When I started to analyze the database, I realized that it contained unreadable information, so it was necessary to transform it with an online application, once the information was converted it was necessary to randomly take some of the converted data to determine that the information was correct.
An additional challenge was to define the additional information that the database had to contain to perform the analysis and learn how to use the recommended formulas.
When the database contained all the information, it was necessary to analyze it in detail to determine additional tools and formulation to have a complete analysis.

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

the best months to launch plays are May and June
The months with the most failed works are October and December.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
  Louis' estimated budget amount for his play Fever reflects that he may not be profitable, his budget is $ 10,000 and goals where plays are between under 1000 and with an amount of 10,000
  

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
  
  
- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
 A graph of goals against pledge to have other points of comparison and estimate if the promise against the goal is being fulfilled.

 To have a more accurate vision, I believe that a graph of goal, pledge and Percentage Funded, can help to validate the success of the project.
